# SpeedScanner
A MacOS and Raspbian cross platform C++ application to actively run network speed tests on and physically map out Wi-Fi networks by grabbing GPS coordinates via a bluetooth connection to a mobile device (not implemented yet). Intended to be highly efficient with low impact on battery life.

Current implementation is early and will be cleaned up and organized in future iterations along with removing dependencies.
